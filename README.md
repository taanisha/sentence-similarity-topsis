# sentence-similarity-topsis
In this project, I employed several sentece similariy models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Subsequently, I applied these models to a dataset to find the cosine similarity. Following that, I compared the performance of these models using the Topsis score ranking. This comparison will be facilitated by utilizing the package I developed and uploaded on PyPI, named 'Topsis-Taanisha-102103123'.
